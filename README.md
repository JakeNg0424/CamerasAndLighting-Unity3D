# Cameras and Lighting in Unity3D
 Get comfortable with cameras and lighting in unity.

A scene lit with both baked and realtime lights
>All three rooms are static with baked lights on them while everything else is in realtime (i.e. player shadow)


Have a character that can move around the space in response to user input.
>Player cube is moved using the arrow keys and can collide against walls


A camera system that switches to different cameras depending on which room the player is in.
>All rooms will trigger a different camera view when entering and exiting them.


A camera that has a fixed position but rotates around one axis to track player.
>Camera rotates to follow player when they're outside or in the yellow room.


Extra:
>The all room cameras have a bunch of post processing like fish eye lens and bloom.
